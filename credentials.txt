You'll need to use Microsoft's RDP to remotely access the server. You will need to be connected to the ECE departmental VPN. If you don't have the VPN client installed on your device you can download it from https://vpn.msstate.edu/. After connecting to the VPN you can open Remote Desktop on your device and use 130.18.65.39 as the computer name to initiate the connection. Your username will be "ECEWIN\ts2434" and your password will be your ECE password. If you need any further assistance, please let me know.
